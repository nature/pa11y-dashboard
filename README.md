Setup
-----

pa11y-dashboard requires [Node.js][node] 0.10+, [PhantomJS][phantom], and [MongoDB][mongo] to be installed. See the [pa11y][pa11y] and [pa11y-webservice][pa11y-webservice] documentation for more information on these dependencies.

You'll then need to clone this repo locally and install dependencies with `npm install`.

Once you have a local clone, you'll need to copy some sample configuration files in order to run the application. From within the repo, run the following commands:

```sh
cp config/development.sample.json config/development.json
cp config/production.sample.json config/production.json
cp config/test.sample.json config/test.json
```

Each of these files defines configurations for a different environment. If you're just running the application locally, then you should be OK with just development configurations. The [available configurations are documented here](#configurations).

Now that you've got your application configured, make sure you have a server running with the `mongod` command in another terminal window. You can then run in each mode with the following commands:

```sh
NODE_ENV=production node index.js   # Run in production
NODE_ENV=development node index.js  # Run in development
NODE_ENV=test node index.js         # Run in test
```

Check the [development instructions](#development) for more information about running locally (and restarting automatically when files change).


Configurations
--------------

The boot configurations for pa11y-dashboard are as follows. Look at the sample JSON files in the repo for example usage.

### port
*(number)* The port to run the application on.

### noindex
*(boolean)* If set to `true` (default), the dashboard will not be indexed by search engines. Set to `false` to allow indexing.

### readonly
*(boolean)* If set to `true`, users will not be able to add, delete or run URLs (defaults to `false`).

### siteMessage
*(string)* A message to display prominently on the site home page. Defaults to `null`.

### webservice
This can either be an object containing [pa11y-webservice configurations][pa11y-webservice-config], or a string which is the base URL of a [pa11y-webservice][pa11y-webservice] instance you are running separately.


Development
-----------

To develop pa11y-dashboard, you'll need to clone the repo and get set up as outlined in the [setup guide](#setup).

You'll need to start the application in test mode with:

```sh
NODE_ENV=test node index.js
```

Now you'll be able to run the following commands:

```sh
make       # Run the lint and test tasks together
make lint  # Run linters with the correct config
make test  # Run integration tests
```

Code with lint errors or failing tests will not be accepted, please use the build tools outlined above.

To compile the client-side JavaScript and CSS, you'll need the following commands. Compiled code is committed to the repository.

```sh
make less    # Compile the site CSS from LESS files
make uglify  # Compile and uglify the client-side JavaScript
```
